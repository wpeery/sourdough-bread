* Parchment paper
* Plastic wrap

## Starter
### Starting Out
For starting out you can either borrow some starter from a local bakery or someone you know or make it yourself. If you decide to make it yourself add a 100g of water and 100g of wheat or rye flour along with a splash of sour beer. I used Dogfish Heads Sea Quench Sour.

Feed the starter once every two days for the first four days. By then you should see some bubbles and activity. Continue feeding once a day for a couple more days. You want to get to a point where the starter can double in size in 4-6 hours at room temperature.

### Feeding
Discard half of the existing starter and mix in 50% water and 50% flour by weight. I usually use about 70g of each. I feed the starter about once a week and store it in the fridge. You can use whatever flour you like but whole wheat and rye can make a more sour and flavorful bread.

When I am about to bake I take it out of the fridge and let it warm up to room temperature. Then I use some of it, feed the rest, and put it back in the fridge.

## Day 1

1. Mix the following ingredients in a large bowl until all ingredients just come together.
 * Bread flour (500g)
 * Water (370g)
 * Avocado oil (10g)
 * Salt (14g)
 * Sourdough starter (150g, room temperature)

1. Let stand for 30 minutes to an hour

1. Every 30 minutes for 2 hours do stretch and folds. Keep covered with plastic wrap in between. A nice video that demonstrates stretch and fold [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzxulQY1Gc)

1. Let prove while covered with plastic wrap till the dough about doubles in size and has a nice jiggle. This usually takes 4-8 hours depending on the starter activity and ambient temperature

1. Shape the dough. This is a bit tricky and there are many techniques you can find. Experiment and find one that works for you. Even if you mess this up it will still taste good, it just may not look as pretty or get as much height in the oven

1. Line the smaller bowl or banneton with a cheese cloth and lightly dust with flour. Place the shaped dough shaped side down. Dust the top lightly with flour, take care to get the edges where the dough is close to touching the cheese cloth. I usually dust with whole wheat flour but it doesn't really matter

1. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge overnight


## Day 2

1. Preheat the oven with the dutch oven inside to 435 f

1. Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper by flipping the small bowl/banneton upside down

1. Score the dough from end to end about a half inch deep. Be confident!

1. Take the dutch oven out of the oven. Lift the dough by the parchment paper and place it into the dutch oven and put the lid on

1. Bake with the lid on for ~40 minutes. Ovens may vary. If you want a crispy crust you can leave the lid off for the last 10 minutes

1. Let cool. Don't cut the bread when feels warm or else you may end up with a gummy texture
